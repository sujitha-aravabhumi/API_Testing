Postbot is similar to Copilot same as in Vss code.
Click on â€˜Postpotâ€™, then click on â€˜Add some test to this requestâ€™

Collection variables,
Environment variables.

If you set a collection variable in scripts, then run this script, automatically the value will update in the collection variable tab.

22-08:

Wherever we have environment-specific to UAT, PROD, SIT, Dev then use environment variables.
If you access baseURL from the same present value in both collection and environment variables, the priority is always for environment variables rather than collection variables.

The priority from highest to lowest is:
Local (Highest Priority)
Data
Environment
Collection
Global (Lowest Priority)
1. Local Variables ðŸ¥‡
Scope: These are temporary variables that exist only within the context of a single request or collection run.
Where to use: They're defined in a pre-request or test script using pm.variables.set().
Purpose: Use these to temporarily override values for a specific run without affecting any other variables. Their value is not saved after the run is complete.
2. Data Variables
Scope: These are variables loaded from external files (CSV or JSON) when using the Collection Runner.
Where to use: They're only available during a collection run and are used for data-driven testing.
Purpose: To run the same request multiple times with different sets of data. For example, testing an endpoint with a list of various users from a CSV file.
